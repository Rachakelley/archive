Procrastinating studying for midterms by finally putting a site together on github. Pretty exciting. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. Installing Jekyll on Windows however, took way longer than it should have because Windows isn't officially supported by Jekyll, but I certainly gained some more knowledge and experience using Windows command line and powershell on the bright side. So that was fun.
